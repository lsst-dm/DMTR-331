\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}


\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

 The purpose of this test plan is to describe all the necessary
requirements and infrastructure for successfully testing the replication
and archive of the Engineering Facility Database (EFD) as implemented
with Kafka, InfluxDB and Chronograf from the summit to the USDF. This
plan will describe the prerequisites for beginning a test campaign, step
by step instructions for each test case and a description of the
expected results and test artifacts.\\[2\baselineskip]NB: The use of the
term reliability in this document is intended to indicate the number of
messages produced relative to the number of messages recorded in the
EFD. The system shall be considered reliable if at least 99.9\% of
produced messages are recorded.\\[2\baselineskip]At a high level, this
test plan is intended to show that a nominally operating EFD at the
summit is able to be replicated to the USDF and archived for future use
either directly or via ingest into a secondary database management
technology. We assume here that the archive technology will be parquet
datasets stored on persistent/redundant disk at the USDF. There are no
latency requirements in this test plan, but we will show that the
replication and archiving are not falling behind relative to the summit
instance in the aggregate. We choose a period of 6 days of continuous
nominal operation in order to test the cases in this test plan.\\
Successful completion of the test campaign will show that:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  users are able to access the same information at the USDF EFD that was
  originally ingested in the summit version
\item
  the reliability of the replication is better than the minimum of 99\%
\item
  archive products are able to be used as a primary source of
  information for historical examination of EFD topics
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{System Overview}
\label{sect:systemoverview}

 The tests will be carried out from within an instance of the notebook
aspect of the RSP running at the data facility where the EFD replication
is currently happening. An appropriate weekly version of the stack will
be chosen.

\subsection{Data Collection}

  Observing is not required for this test campaign.

\subsection{Verification Environment}
\label{sect:hwconf}
  The environment will be within notebooks running a modern stack.

  \subsection{Entry Criteria}
  \begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Before beginning this test, a set of viability tests shall be
  performed. These will show:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The system demonstrates reliability (number of recorded
    messages/number of produced messages) of greater than 99.9\%
  \item
    The summit data is being replicated to the instance at NCSA
  \item
    Chronograf is set up and running at both the summit and NCSA
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The summit network and Kubernetes cluster are performing nominally
\item
  A number of telemetry topics are reliably producing telemetry at both
  low frequency (1 Hz) and high frequency (\textgreater{} 10 Hz).
\item
  The notebook aspect of the RSP is deployed in the summit Kubernetes
  cluster
\item
  The summit EFD is reliably replicated to an EFD instance running in a
  data facility
\item
  The notebook aspect of the RSP is deployed in the same data facility
  as that running the replicated EFD
\item
  The most recent version of the EFD client python modules are installed
  in the various deployed notebook aspects
\item
  The replication system is also successfully archiving EFD topics to
  parquet files on persistent disk at the data facility
\end{enumerate}
